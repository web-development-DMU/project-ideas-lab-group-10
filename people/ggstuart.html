            <h2>Graeme Stuart</h2>
            <p>
                I'm module leader and have a few decades of experience with web development.
                I've built a few large systems for research projects over the years.
                Also several small ones for research, teaching etc.
                I also wrote a book on JavaScript game development.

                If your lab tutor can't help, maybe I can.
                If you think so then work with your lab tutor to formulate a sensible question.
                You can email me or ask in the lectures.

            <h2>Project ideas</h2>
            <p>
                I was thinking about a university webpage for listing available degree programmes.
                It would need an admin dashboard for setting up programmes and modules.
                The student-facing pages would need to be really easy to use.
