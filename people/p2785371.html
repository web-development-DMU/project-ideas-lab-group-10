    <h1>Orion Tebbutt</h1>

    <p>
        I am Orion, im studying software enginering. I am currently slowly working on two projects in my free time.
        One of which is creating a website for my regiment in a english civil war recancement that i take part in. 
        The other project im working on is a spell checking software aimed at dyslxic people.
        I have done HTML and CSS before and have a understanding of both of them. 
        This module im hoping to increase my skills in HTML and CSS and learn JavaScript.
