    <h1>Profile</h1>
    <h2>Muhammad Hamza</h2>
    <p> My name is Muhammad Hamza. I am currently a Level 5 student at DMU studying Software Engineering. 
        I am enrolled in the Web Application Development module.
        
    </p>

    <h2> What experience do I have in web development?</h2>
    <p>
        I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and programming concepts. I am continuously improving my 
        understanding of how web applications work.
        </p>

<p>
I am keen to learn web development in more depth and enhance my skills, especially in connecting 
the front-end with the back-end. I want to gain practical experience in building complete web applications.
</p>

<p>
I would love to be involved in a practical and real-world web application project where I can 
improve my technical skills and teamwork experience.
